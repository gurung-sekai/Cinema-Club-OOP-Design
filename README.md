# Cinema-Club-OOP-Design
Object-oriented analysis and UML design of a cinema ticket-booking system. Includes textual analysis, class &amp; use-case diagrams, formal use-case specs, and an OOP/data-structures report.

# Bostall Heath Cinema Club – OOP Design Case Study

A complete **object-oriented analysis and design project** based on a real-world
cinema-booking scenario.  
This repository contains the design documents, UML diagrams within PDF, and written
analysis I produced to model the system.

## Project Overview
The goal was to design the software for a private members’ cinema club,
capturing all key processes—from membership management to ticket booking
and daily operations—using **object-oriented design (OOD)** techniques.

## Key Deliverables
- **Textual Analysis**  
  Identified candidate objects, classes, attributes, and methods from the
  narrative case study.

- **UML Diagrams**  
  *Class Diagram* – Shows system structure, relationships, and key attributes.  
  *Use-Case Diagram* – Illustrates the interactions between members,
  secretary, and booking system.

- **Formal Use-Case Descriptions**  
  Step-by-step flows for scenarios such as membership renewal and ticket
  booking.

- **Technical Report**  
  A 1,000-word explanation of:
  - Core OOP principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, aggregation.
  - Common data structures used in software development: stacks, queues,
    vectors, linked lists.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Design** – translating real requirements into classes,
  attributes, and operations.
- **UML Modelling** – producing professional class and use-case diagrams.
- **Technical Writing** – concise, structured documentation of system design
  and theoretical concepts.

## Purpose
This project highlights my ability to:
- Analyse complex requirements.
- Model a software system before implementation.
- Communicate design decisions clearly—an essential step in any
software-engineering process.

*Note: This is a **design/documentation project**—no executable code is included.*
